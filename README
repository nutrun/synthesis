= Synthesis

== Philosophy

Currently we believe that developers are writing unnecessary <em>dependency wired</em> tests to cover uncertainty about the validity of simulated interactions in their <em>dependency neutral</em> tests.  In other words, we cannot be certain that all our simulated interaction based tests 'join up'.  If it were possible to correlate the simulated interactions in our tests, then we should be able to do away with the need to write large numbers of complex, slow and brittle wired tests (apart from those which interact with the boundaries of the SUT).

Synthesis combines lightweight, <em>dependency neutral</em> tests to build confidence that the system under test is complete and reduces the need for large, overarching tests.

== Installation

 sudo gem i synthesis

== Download

Synthesis RubyForge page ( http://rubyforge.org/projects/synthesis )

== Dependencies

Synthesis's core doesn't have any dependencies. 

When used with the Mocha adapter, it will depend on the Mocha[http://mocha.rubyforge.org] library.

When used with the RSpec adapter, it will depend on the RSpec[http://rspec.info/] library.

When used with the Expectations adapter, it will depend on the Expectations[http://expectations.rubyforge.org] library.

== Usage

Synthesis can be used through its Rake task. It currently has three supported adapters: Mocha (with Test::Unit), RSpec and Expectations. If +adapter+ is not explicitly specified, the Mocha adapter will be used by default. 

By default, Synthesis outputs to +STDOUT+, but output can be redirected to alternative IO streams.

Synthesis can be setup to ignore certain classes or modules when collecting expectations for verification.

If +pattern+ is not specified, it will default to <tt>test/**/*.rb</tt>

== Usage examples

To use with Test::Unit and Mocha, ignoring Array and Hash:

  require "synthesis/task"
	
  Synthesis::Task.new do |t|
    t.pattern = 'test/unit/**/*_test.rb'
    t.ignore Array, Hash
  end

To use with RSpec, running all specs in the <tt>spec</tt> directory:

  require "synthesis/task"

  Synthesis::Task.new do |t|
    t.adapter = :rspec
    t.pattern = 'spec/**/*_spec.rb'
  end

To use with Expectations, redirecting output to a file

  require "synthesis/task"
	
  Synthesis::Task.new do |t|
    t.adapter = :expectations
    t.out = File.new "synthesis.test.txt", "a"
  end

== Known Issues

Reporting the location (filename and line number) of tested/untested expectations doesn't work as intended with the Expectations adapter.
